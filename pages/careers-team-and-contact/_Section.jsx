            Company culture is important to us, so why not join a startup that
            feels like a family? We may be busy cracking the code on machine
            intelligence, but we’ve got a work-hard, play-hard attitude. Our
            kitchen is stocked with salty and sweet snacks, and on Wednesdays
            we enjoy catered lunches from a variety of local restaurants.

            blow off steam with company events, happy hours and other fun
            activities. In the past, we’ve cheered on the SF Giants, baked
            pies at Pie Ranch in Pescadero, and do-si-doed through the night.

                globally and drove Palm’s annual smartphone business to more
