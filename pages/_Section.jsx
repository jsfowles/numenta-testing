          <Strong>Numenta</Strong> is tackling one of the most
          important scientific challenges of all time: reverse engineering
          the neocortex. Studying how the brain works helps us understand
          the principles of intelligence and build machines that work on the
          same principles. We believe that understanding how the neocortex works
          is the fastest path to machine intelligence, and creating intelligent
          machines is important for the continued success of humankind.
