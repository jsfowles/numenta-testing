[Numenta Anomaly Benchmark Competition](http://numenta.org/nab/) for Real-Time
Anomaly Detection at [IEEE WCCI 2016](http://www.wcci2016.org/programs.php?id=home)
(World Congress on Computational Intelligence).

### About Competition

Do you have an algorithm that detects anomalies in streaming data? Or a dataset
of real-world, time-series data with labeled anomalies? If so, youâ€™re encouraged
to enter the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Competition.

### About Conference

IEEE WCCI has traditionally been the largest technical event in the field of
computational intelligence, hosting three separate prestigious conferences
(IJCNN, FUZZ-IEEE, IEEE CEC) under one roof. Over the years the event has
provided a platform for highly acclaimed intellectuals from all over the world
to discuss and present their research findings on computational intelligence.
The organizing committee will put in place a rich and varied technical program
which is designed to engage participants in cross-fertilization of ideas among
the three big areas in computational intelligence. The event will also offer a
series of social functions, such as welcome reception, conference banquet etc.,
which will serve as a good channel to establish new connections and foster
everlasting friendship among fellow counterparts.
