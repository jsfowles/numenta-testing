        Based on a wealth of neuroscience evidence we have created HTM
        (Hierarchical Temporal Memory), a theoretical framework for both
        biological and machine intelligence. When applied to computers, HTM is
        well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and
        ultimately sensori-motor applications.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        At the core of HTM are learning algorithms that can store, learn, infer
        and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine learning
        methods, HTM learns time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a
        continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise, and high capacity, meaning
        that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        HTM works best with data that meets the following characteristics:

          Streaming data rather than batch data files
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Data with time-based patterns
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models
          is impractical

          Subtle patterns that canâ€™t always be seen by humans
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Data for which simple techniques such as thresholds yield
          substantial false positives and false negatives
        </ListItem>
      </List>
      <Paragraph>
        Our technology has been tested and implemented in software, all of
        which is developed with best practices and suitable for deploying in
        commercial applications.
